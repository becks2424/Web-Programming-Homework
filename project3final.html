		after I got done doing homework with a few of my friends. It has no real meaning behind it,</br>
		but I just felt like it made a good picture, with nature being my usual go to when I am stressed.</b></p>

	    <p style="color:white; font-size:130%"> This is a picture I took after the sudden "Spring" snow storm<br>

		<p style="color:white; font-size:130%"> This is a picture I randomly took, as I enjoyed the Spring not so Spring<br>
		weather. I sometimes enjoy taking random pictures with no definite meaning as I mentioned before,<br/>
		because it serves as a good way in which I can exhaust my free time.</p>
