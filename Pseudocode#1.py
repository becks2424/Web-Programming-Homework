#this program will allow the doctor and nurse to stay in communication in order
#to make sure the patients are being kept track of and to avoid
#any misunderstandings.


#Step1
#The waiting room should be able to have a patient list directory where patients
#that have already visited there can just check in by providing their first
#and last name which the nurse can enter in the system and look up. They will also be
#able to enter their birthdate in order to have accurate information
#pulled up from the system.

#Step2
#After the patient checks in with the nurse, once they get to the exam room,
#the doctor will be able to see what they're visiting for by entering their
#name and birthdate in order to get the information entered by the nurse in the
#waiting room.

#Step 3
#After the doctor sees the patient, they will enter the medication to be given
#to the patient and send it back to the nurse using the birthdate as sort of a
#passcode to make sure it is prescribed to the right patient.

#Step 4
#after the patient gets back to the waiting room, the nurse will be able
#to tell that they already visited by just asking for their birthdate
#and the information that will come up will consist of the prescription
#given by the doctor, confirming that they have already visited with the doctor.

#Step 5
#once the patient gets their prescription from the nurse, she checks the name off
#and puts them on the patients checked list
#so that she can go back in anytime and double check just to make sure.

#all this will be done using two different programs. One used by the nurse
#the other by the doctor but they will both be linked to eachother
#to make communication easier.
