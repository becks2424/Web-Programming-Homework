		<h3>WHY PHOTOGRAPHY?:</h3>
		
		<p class="description">My name is Rebecca Menda, I am a Computer Science major student at Graceland University.<br>
		I am originally from Zambia, Africa, and I am currently in the US for education purposes only. growing up,
		my father enjoyed taking pictures of the family on every occasion that he could, and for the longest I didn't realize
		how much of an impact those little moments had on me until I got a little older. After I got to Graceland, the surroundings helped 
		me spend more time alone around nature and increased my appreciation of it's beauty. This in turn led to me taking pictures every now
		and then until it became a hobby.<br/><p/>

		<h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
		
		<p class="description"> I am the only girl in a family of two, my brother is a Mechanical Engineering major at M-Tech.
        We've both sort of always been fans of photography growing up, and we just enjoy it as our hobby.<br/> </p>
